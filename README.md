# PhotoStorageEngine
A personalized photo storage engine to upload and hide image files from local machine to a unified interface

Version 1.2 (Database connection and migration to be updated in Version 1.3)

The directory structure is not to be sabotaged as it adheres to flask documentation. The driver code has
paths local to my machine, so it has to be changed to prevent err when run on other machines

The front end is in templates directory, and the backend is the driver file written in flask framework

Platform Independent dependencies.
